1. plug Pico in USB port w/ button pressed
2. move .uf2 file to its storage and wait until it writes into firmware and reloads
3. move adafruit_hid from the current folder to Pico's lib folder
4. move boot.py and code.py to root of Pico's storage
5. edit code.py to change the mouse's movement 
6. plug it off and plug it on to start executing the code.py (at this step your jiggler should be ready to go)
7. reset Flash memory with flash_nuke.uf2 file if needed
